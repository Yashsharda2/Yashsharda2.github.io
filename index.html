        Hi, I’m Yash Sharda, a 2nd-year ECE student interested in circuits,
        FPGA design, and verification. I like working close to the
        hardware–software boundary and exploring different hardware platforms
        to understand how low-level systems are built. Currently, I’m working
        on implementing image processing algorithms on the Vaaman FPGA board,
        where the pipeline operates on hex-formatted data and performs basic
        pixel-level operations in hardware, with the processed output intended
        for display.
